# OpenWeatherMap-PHP-Api-Service (EXT:openweathermap\_php\_api\_service)

This extension provides a wrapper for the library OpenWeatherMap-PHP-Api [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-Api).

It allows developers to use the library in their TYPO3 extension without much hassle.

The library uses the TYPO3 caching framework and TYPO3’s own methods to fetch URLs.

## Requirements

This extension does not have any major requirements

- PHP 5.3-7.2
- TYPO3 CMS 6.2 up to 8LTS (8.7)
- TYPO3 should obviously be able to access the internet

## Installation

Just install the extension from the TER or manually.

## Configuration

Some basic configuration needs to be done:

- You need an AppID / API Key from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/). Enter this AppID in the extension configuration inside the extension manager.
- Optionally change the cache lifetime in the extension configuration.

## Usage

Get an instance of the service and the actual API class:
```php
    /** @var \RauchF\OpenweathermapPhpApiService\Service\OpenweathermapPhpApiService $owmService */
    $owmService = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstanceService('openweathermap_php_api');
    $owmApi = $owmService->getOpenweathermapPhpApi();
```

Now you can use any API method:

```php
    $weatherData = $owmApi->getRawWeatherData(
        $query,
        'metric',
        'en',
        $owmService->getApiKey(),
        'json'
    );
```
